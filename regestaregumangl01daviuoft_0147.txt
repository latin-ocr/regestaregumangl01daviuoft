the Lent of 1096 sent to Devon and Cornwall and Exeter his optimates Walchelin Bp.
of winchester, Ranulf the Chaplain, William Chievre and Hardin son of Belnold,
‘ad investiganda regalia placita! They found the abbot in possession of
Wlurintuna‚ and claimed it as royal demesne. But he proved his title and this
charter was then granted to him. This early mention of an Iter is noteworthy.
