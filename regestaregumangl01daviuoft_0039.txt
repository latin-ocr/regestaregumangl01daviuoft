ξ 31. Grants of fairs and markets are not very numerous in the charters,
though forty-two markets are specially mentioned in Domesday Book.l But
a few interesting grants will be found in the calendar. William Ι granted
to Malmesbury Abbey an annual fair of five days’ duration32 William II
gave the Bishop and the Old Minster of Winchester a fair, to be held at
St. Giles' church on the eastern hill outside Winchester, on the day of the
saint, the day before and the day after.3 In this case the Bishop was to have
the whole of the royal justice and customs in the city for the period of the
fair and ‘all the customs which the King would have if the fair were his
own ’. This phrase is significant3 it points to the existence of a customary
fair-right which was too well known to need rehearsal. We have also three
cases in which fairs are granted in Normandy3 two charters to the monks
of St. J ames de Beuvron4 by William I, and a third, to the monks of Mont
St. Michel by Duke Robert.⁵ A weekly market is granted to the monks
of Battle, of Evesham, and of Thorney.6 In Normandy we find similar
grants to St. J ames de Beuvron, St. Amand of Rouen, and Mont St. ΜίοΙιΘΙ.7

Closely akin to such grants are those which confer the whole or part of a
borough. In 1077 we have a mandate from William I commanding that
the borough of Fordwich shall be restored to St. Augustino of Oanterbury 3
it had come into the hands of Haimo the sheriff of Kent through the
abbot's fraud or folly.8 Two-thirds of the borough had been granted by
Edward the Confessor ; the remaining third was given by Odo of Bayeuxf'
with the king's licence. Sandwich in like manner belonged to the monks
of Christ Church, Canterbury, and was appropriated to the purpose of
supplying them with raiment.¹0 In 1077 Odo of Bayeux made over to the
monks‚ with the king’s licence, certain houses and rights which he held in
the borough, and we learn from Domesday that this grant had duly taken
