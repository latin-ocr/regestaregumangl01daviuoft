effect} The ‘port’ of Evesham, which Edward the Confessor had granted to
Evesham Abbey‚ was confirmed by William I to Abbot AEthelwig. It is
not called a borough in Domesday‚ but had a population of rent-paying
tenants who presumably enj oyed some form of burgess-right.2 The whole city
of Bath was given to the bishop, between 1089 and 1091, in free alms 3 3 but
we leam from Domesday that this was merely a transference to the bishop
of property which had formerly been vested in the monks of Bath Abbey.⁴

The harbour of Whitby was granted by William II to the monks‚⁵ but it
must have been of small valae, since it is not mentioned in Domesday. Of

similar grants in Normandy we have only to note two cases, The Holy
Trinity of Rouen received from William I the bourg of Quetehou and a
part of the bourg of Caen.⁰

Private mints are rarely mentioned in the charters. The Abbot of Bury
and the Bishop of Bath are the only English prelates whose charters contain
explicit references to their moneyers.7 In Normandy the privilege was
zealously guarded. No one might coin money, good or bad, except at the
mints of Rouen and Βογο1111.8 But in England the custom of permitting
private mints was deeply rooted, and the Conqueror seems to have respected
vested interests. In grants of toll and custom he and his son were lavish
enough. It seems to have been a recognized principle that the personal
property of men of religion (and sometimes of their tenants) should go
free both by sea and by land3 30 0130 whatever they required for their

§32 So many of our charters relate 130 1110 privileges of ecclesiastical
bodies that we should expect them to throw some light on the jurisdiction
of ecclesiastica] 0011113. But this 13 0 subject on which they yield little
information. A private grant of the year 1073 contains an enigmatical
concession to the monks of St. Nicholas at Bramber3 William de Braosc
grants the placita hominum de christianitate at Steyning and Bramber
castle.¹⁰ This may mean merely the jurisdiction over ecclesiastical persons 3
a more natural interpretation would be that, as the holder of hundreda]
jurisdiction‚ 110 claimed certain spiritual offences as pertaining to his court.
It may be noticed, in this connexion, that the Conqueror's ordinance
concerning the spiritual courts forbids interference by sheriffs or other
Zaymen.¹¹ That the Curia Regis paid very little attention 10 1110 11111113 of
the two jurisdictions is evident from the correspondence between William I
and Lanfranc respecting Abbot Simeon of Ely. The archbishop 13 com-
manded to see that Abbot Simeon is consecrated forthwith, 311100 13110 abbot's
charters entitle him to be consecrated wherever the king pleases.12
William II instructs his Curia to adjudicate upon a claim to burial—dues‚
oblations, and tithes.¹3 He prohibits the Abbot of St. Augustine’s from.
infringing the rights of Canterbury Gathedral in the matter of bell-ringing.¹4
