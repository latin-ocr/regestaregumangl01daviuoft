WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR 35

133, Memorandum (appended to preceding record). [c. 1081]
Of a confirmation which William I made, to St. Martin [of Marmoutier] and Bernouville.
St. George [of Bohun], of a grant to St. George's priory which Humphrey de
Bohun gave in augmentation of his previous endowment. This was done at
Humphrey's request when the King was at Bernouville [Eure], sitting on his
carpet between the church and the forester's house, after he had returned from
En land.

The date of this confirmation can only be conjectured. But assuming the date of No. 132
10 be Dec. 27, 1080, this would be granted late in 1081, the King being absent in
England and Wales for a great part of 1081.

134. Letter by William I, ‘ Anglorum Rex et Dux Normannorum,' to [1077-80
Gregory VII. ’ἔ 1080.]
The King has received through Hubert, the Papal legate, a demand that he
should do fealty to the Pope and his successors. This he refuses as unprece-
dented. But he will cause the arrears of Peter's pence to be collected. He
begs the prayers of the Pope for himself and the realm.
