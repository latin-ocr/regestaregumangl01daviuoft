PREFACE vii

English Historical Review. Professor Tait of Manchester and Pro-
fessor Haskins of Harvard‚ U.S.A.‚ undertook the thankless work
of ploos-reading, and gave inestimable help both in pointing out new
materials and in criticizing the calendar. Last, but by no means
least, Mr. R. J. WhitwelL one of the original band who projected
the calendar, has assisted continuously in the search for documents‚
and has compiled the index of places. It is to be feared that the
work, to which so many scholars have contributed‚ may disappoint
their legitimate expectations. The editor can only ask for that
degree of indulgence which is due to a labour of love, undertaken
in the interests of historica] scholarship.

H. W. O. DAVIS.
