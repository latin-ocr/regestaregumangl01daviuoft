Peter received it. Robert of Mortain and Roger of Shrewsbury were both tenants in
chief in Bedfordshire.

Mr. Bayley (Vict. Cozmty History, Durham, ii. 137—8) considers that the effect of this ἰ

chartei· was to transfer to the Bp. of Durham the jura reyaHa, and that these had ,j
hitherto been exercised by the Earl over the Bishop's territories. The authenticity of “
the document has been questioned (Greenwell in Feodarz'um, us). If genuine, it is f

prior to Mowbray’s rebellion in 1095.
