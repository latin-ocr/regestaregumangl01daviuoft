[Westminster Abbey ‘ Domesday ², fo. 237 v⁰ (copy).]

In Domesday Book this manor belongs to Westminster‚ and there is a reference to this
grant of the King's: ‘Hoc manerium tenuit Aluuinus teignus T. R. Ε. et vendere
potuit. De hoc manerio revocat abbas W. regem sibi concessisse ‘ (D. B. i. 135).

Dated ‘ post descriptionem totius Angliae '. This writ is interesting because D. B. notes
that Pirford which had been assessed T.R.E. at 27 hides had been reduced 10
16 hides by Harold‚ and that the King had never confirmed the reduction by his
writ. Three hides of the manor were royal forest (D. B. i. 32).

Armitage Robinson, Flete's History of Westminster Abba-ts, p. 141.]
The appearance of Abbot Edwin (†1071) and William fitz Osbern (†1071)‚ in connexion

with William of Mortain who succeeded his father in 1091, is fatal to the genuine·

ness of this charter. The manor of Cleygate appears among the Surrey possessions
of the abbey in D. B. 1. 32. But Long Ditton is entered (D. B. 1. 35) as belonging
entirely to Richard fitz Gilbert.
