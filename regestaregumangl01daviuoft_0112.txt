62 WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR

The Liber Rubens (Hist. szelm. Scriptis. Tres, p. ccecxxivff.) makes Bp, Walchffl. the
recipient of this grant, as of that conferi-ing Welton (infra, No. 272). Howden
appears in D. B. as belonging to the Bp. of Durham (i. 304 b). Simeon of Durham
says that Bp. William was the recipient.

[108043 ] 232, N otification by William I to all men, present and future.

⁴ ’ That he has given to the monastery of St. Pancras at Lewes a manor called
Walton in Norsolk, with all the appurtenances which William of Warenne
holds in that manor from the King. This gift is made for the souls of
King Edwaffl, Count Robert, the King's father, the King himself, Queen
Matiffla, the King's sons and successore, William of Warenne and his wife,
Gundrada [the King's daughter].1 The monks of Lewes are to possess the
said manor with the same liberties which pertain to other churches founded
by the King’s barons with his consent3 and the King is to have the same
rights in that benefaction as in others.

Sanetus Petrus ⁹, that is, St. Peter of Cluny. On Gundrada see Freeman in Ε.Η. R.

For Staines see D. Β. i. 128. It appears by this record that the abbey received Staines

after the time of King Edward: ‘valet xxxv librae. Quando receperunt similiter. ¹
T. R. E. xl librae.’ But while this document records a genuine grant, it has ἦ
a family resemblance to some patent forgeries of the Westminster scribes. ³¹
