xvi INTRODUCTION

THE CHANCERY oF WILLIAM Ι AND WILLIAM ΙΙ.

ξς). It is evident that the English clement was strong in the chancery
of William Ι. Some of his more elaborate charters have many character-
istics in common with the Old English diploma 3¹ a number of his writs are
old English both in language and in form. We have not, however, much
information as to the men by whom the pre-Conquest traditions of the
chancery were perpetuated. The influence which Regenbald exercised in
the early days after William's coronation is attested by two writs in his
favour, one confirming him 111 1113 former possessions, the other making
new grants to him.'-' We have seen above how the chaplains Peter
and Osbern were advaneed to bishoprics. Further, we find the priest
Ingelric regularly employed in the chancery during the years 1067-9,
and wealthy enough to endow out of his own possessions the important
church of St. Martin le Grrand.3 Ingelric may have filled the chancellor’s
place for a short space after the retirement of Regenbald3 but in 1068
the Norman chaplain Herfast is found holding the title of chancellor,
with Ingelric as his subordinate.⁴ The promotion of Peter and Osbern
falls in the year 1072. From that time onwards the documents mention
no chaplains of English birth. This is not conclusive3 for the chaplains
of the Conqueror attest his charters only by exception. But the chaplains
of whom we learn from other sources are foreigners.

ξΙΟ. We may begin with the Chancellors. Herfast‚ the successor of
Regenbald, had been long in the service of Duke William. He was already
William's chaplain when he attended Lanfranc’s lectures at the school of
Bec (before 1059) and provoked the derision of the scholars by his pomp
and ignorance. He is treated with contempt by William of Malmesbury:
parcae, ut alunt, mentis homo et nonnulla ex parte in litteris eruditus. But
the chronicler admits that Herfast passed for a scholar in Normandy before
Lanfranc’s appea1·ance.⁵ Herfast received the see of Elmham after the deposi-
tion of AEthelmaer (1070). If we may trust the evidence of a suspicions charter

of St. Augustine's, Canterbury,⁰ 116 was succeeded by Osbern, who appears ³
among the witnesses 33 Osbertus Cancellarz'us.⁶ The form of the charter -’

13 abnormal, but the witnesses are consistent with a date not earlier than

1070 or later than 1072. 111 1072 Osbern obtained the see of Exeter. It is, '¹³
however, possible that the Canterbury scribe has mistakenly expanded the ·
conti-action ς03. cancellarii' in his original and that the chancellor in .

question was Osmund, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury. Osmund attests
as chancellor a charter of about 1073.7 His name appears to be Norman3 for
a certain Osmund clericus attests a charter of the Duchess Gonnor‚ the
widow of Duke Richard of Normandy,⁸ and other Osmunds are mentioned
in Orderic. A document of the fifteenth century states that Osmund was
