INTRODUCTION xiii

have been the organization of the West-Saxon chancery, rather than the
methods of drastsmanship‚ which were transformed by foreign infiuence.
The genuine charters of the Confessor are framed in harmony with Old
English traditions. His writs are modelled on those of Cnut‚ and the form
of the writ, the chief technical innovation of the period, is neither French
nor Lotharingian.

ᾗ 5. The title of Chancellor first appears in the reign of the Confessor,
In his genuine charters it is only given to one man, Regenbald; 1 0116 of
the charters in which Regenbald is called chancellor belongs to the end
of the reign3 the other is probably no earlier. Until the year 1054 it
seems 130 have been a common, though not a regular practice, that Edward’s
charters should be witnessed by a certain number of his priests. Perhaps
13116 official text of the charters gave their names in order of seniority.
But in the copies which we possess the order of the names is capricious.
Thus in 1050 Robert takes precedence of Regenbald, but in 1052 their
positions are reversed.2 Our only clue to the relative dignity of the
various king’s priests is the order of their ecclesiastica] promotions. Under
Edward the Confessor we find the following appointments : 3

1042, Stigand to East Anglia.
1045, Hermann to Ramsbury.
1046, Leofric to Crediton.
1047, Η606 to Selsey.

1050, Ulf to Dorchester.

1051, William to London.
1053, Kinsige to York.

1061, Griso to Wells.

§a It seems clear that Stigand waS, at Edward's accession, the most
important of the surviving chaplains of the Danish dynasty. He
served successively Cnut, Harthacnut, and Edward the Confessor.4 There
is 110 evidence that 116 bore the title of chancellor‚ but good reason for
thinking that, under whatever title, he was at the head of the secretariat.
Leofric is expressly styled reyis cancellarius by Florence of worcester35
and there is the less reason to doubt the statement since the 566 of Crediton,
to which Leofric succeeded, had been closely connected with that of WVor-
cester. Possibly Leofric had been preceded in the chancellorship by
Hermann of Ramsbury, who attests as a presbyter at the beginning of
the reign.6 But this is a mere possibility. Hermann may have owed
his preferment to merits of a less worldly character, since the Conqueror
and Lanfranc left him in peaceful possession of his see. Heca does not
attest the charters of Edward, and it is unlikely that he held high office.
But Ulf the Norman, whose appointment to Dorchester was so nearly
annulled by the synod of Vercelli, would scarcely have been promoted by
a ruler of Edward’s character unless he had been able to urge the claims
of a confidential servant. One is the more inclined to rank him among
