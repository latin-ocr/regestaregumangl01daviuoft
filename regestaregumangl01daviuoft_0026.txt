xx INTRODUCTION

03011111ν or OSBERT, afterwards Bishop of Exeter, brother of William fitz
osbern, has been discussed above (pp. xv-xvi).

Pmm, afterwards Bishop of Lichfield (1075), 13 styled a royal chaplain
in Hardy's edition of Le Neve's Fasti. But no authority is given for this
statement, which is perhaps due to a mere confusion between Peter and
Robert de Limesey, his successor to the see.

RMNALD or REGINALD the Younger attests a Norman charter of April
1067 (Calendar‚ 6 α) and two Norman charters of 1080 (calendar, 121, 126).
By 1083 he had become a monk at Jumieges‚ and had given to that
foundation his land and gardens at Bayeux (Calendar‚ 193). His name
appears in a suspicious Westminster charter of 1076 (Calendar‚ 90). His
property at Bayeux had been previously held by a certain Stephen, who
was probably like himself a ducal chaplain (Calendar, 193). Rainald
received the abbey of Abingdon in June 1084 (Hist. Mon. Abin9d0n‚ ii. 15).

Romu: THE CHAPLAm appears as a witness to documents of 1068
(Calendar, 22), 1076 (ib. 90), 1081 (ib. 144*)‚ 1080 (ib. 146a. and 148*).
Some of these documents are spurious, but the forgers seem to have had
genuine witness-lists at their disposal. It may well be doubted whether
all these attestations are by the same person. One of them occurs in
a Norman document (Calendar, 146 a), the rest in English charters. We
know of at least two chaplains of William I who bore this name: Robert
de Limesey, who received the see of Chester in 1085 (Florence‚ s. a.); and
Robert Bloet (v. supra, p. xvii). Perhaps a third should be added in the
person of Robert Losinga, who received the 300 of Hereford in 1079, being
at that time in deacon's orders (Florence‚ s. a.).

SAMSON OF BAYEUX was originally a clerk of Bayeux cathedral‚ and
received a foreign education at the expense of Bishop Odo (Orderic‚ ii. 249,
266). Between 1074 and 1085 he obtained from William I the church of

St. Mary of Wolverhampton (Calendar, 210). He appears as a witness in ¹

a spurious Westminster charter of 1081 (0010111101, 144*). In 1082 he is
styled Treasurer of Bayeux (Calendar‚ 147). He attests several other

charters of 1082 and later dates (Calendar 146 a, 158, 182, 199). Ηο was 2

a brother of Thomas of Bayeux, Archbishop of York.

STIGAND, promoted to the see of Selsey in 1070, is described by Florence
as a chaplain (s. a.).

Tnonms, who attests in 1068 (Calendar, 22), 13 probably to be identified
with Thomas, the canon of Bayeux, who received the see of York in 1070
(Florence‚ s. a.) ; we have no other evidence that Thomas of Bayeux was
a chaplain. It is, however, the more probable that he held this rank, since
we afterwards find his brother Samson in the chancery.

VALDEerus is only known through a charter (Calendar, 223) 111 which he ν
appears as a tenant of the house of St. Mary of Burton. Possibly he is to ,
be identified with the Baldwin mentioned above. '

WALCHELIN, promoted 130 13110 300 of Winchester in 1070, 13 called a ζ
chaplain by Florence (s. a.). s
WALTER. A chaplain of this name attests in 1068 (calendar, 22); and 5
between 1080 and 1086 we find a Walter attesting a charter to St. Pancras
