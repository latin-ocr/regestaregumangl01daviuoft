Queen Matilda did not arrive in England till after Easter 1068 (Or-cleric, ii. 181). Freeman
(SomersetArch. SocProceedinqs, u.s.) argues for 1068 as the date. This would agree with
the note of the indiction. William fitz Osbern was put in command of York early in
1069, and remained there when the King came south for Easter‚ and immediately after
Easter Matilda returned to Normandy. Only in 1068 could all the witnesses here col-
lected be got together. The Waeclfsiy who appears among the bps. must be a copyist's
blunder (9Wu1fstan). This charter appears to have been issued on the same occasion
as the charter of William Ι to St. Martin's le Grand [No. 22], if we may judge from
a comparison of the list of witnesses. The St. Martin’s chartei· was unknown to
Mr. Freeman, but corroborates his arguments as to the date of the present document.

24. Notification that in the year 1068 William the carl, son of Osbern 1068.
Dapifer, having gone beyond the sea with his lord King William, and being
detained there by some illness, gave to the Holy Trinity, Rouen, for his soul's

¹ sake, the dues of all the wood called Longboel. The earl's son William coming

to the abbey afterwards gladly confirmed his father's gift.
Siqua: William fitz Osbern, Earl [of Hereford]; William his son3 William

Alis; Gozelin son of Ivo; Durand the forester.

That the land at Perton [co. Staffs] belongs to the altar of St. Peter of
Westminster as fully and freely as King Edward, the King's kinsman gave it.

The date of Leofwin’s death is unknown. His successor, Peter, was consecrated 1n 1072
(see the Acts of Lanfranc in Thorpe's ed. of A. S. C. i. 387). It may be assumed that
this writ was issued before the revolt of Earl Edwin in 1068. Perton is entered m
Domesday as the property of Westminster (D. B. i. 247 b).

²25a. Confirmation by William Ι to St. Martin of Troarn. [1067-8.]
. Of a grant made by Herbe-rt, son of Geoffrey [de l'Epinay] of lands at
l Caumont sur Dive and salt-pits in La Touque.
