INTRODUOTION ‘ xxxv

On the other hand, he appears in two charters as enforcing the jurisdiction
of an archdeacon’s court31 from which we may perhaps infer that inferior
secular courts were not allowed to encroach upon the co'urts-christian.

PLAN or THE CALENDAR.

{v 33. In describing documents the editor and his colleagues have avoided
any attempt at rigid classification. Under William I and William II the
traditions of the royal chancery were changing rapidly, and it would seem
that charters were sometimes drawn up by the persons in whose favour
they were issued. The king's clerks drew a distinction between the writ
(breve) and the diploma (carta);2 and they were tending to adopt, for
administrative purposeS‚ a stereotyped form of writ in which the Old English
valediction was replaced by a short list of witnesses and a note of the place
of issue. But the name breve might be applied to any form of epistolary
communication, as, for instance, to the returns of the Domesday com·
missioners.3 And there grew up a practice of casting even elaborate grants
of privileges into the form of a letter generally addressed. Diplomas more
or less modelled on Old English lines and sometimes written in duplicate
versions, Old English and Latin, upon the same parchment were not
uncommon.4 But the old skill in composing such documents was dying
out, and hardly any irregularity of style can be taken as conclusive against
authenticity. We have described this latter class of documents by the
terms ‘diploma' and ‘charter’. Documents of the breve type have been
classified as ⁶ notifications ' and ‘precepts '. Those described as ‘ notifications
generally addressed' open with a salutation ‘ to archbishops, bishops, abbots‚
earls‚ barons, sheriffs' or some equivalent formula. They might perhaps be
described as ‘writ-charters’.⁵ The type is uncommon before 1100. The
normal breve of the first two Norman reigns is still a letter addressed
to the magnates of a shire-court. In this respect it is faithful to Old

¹ English usage.6

The calendar includes a number of records of law-suits, which were heard
before the king or the Curia Regis. These are described by the terms
‘ record' or ‘memorandum ³. Most of them appear to be the work of private
hands, but they are so important as a source of historica] information that

¹ it seemed essentia] to take notice of them. Unless the contrary is stated,

 

 

the language of a document is Latin. The description ‘bilingual' means
that both a Latin and an Old English version are extant. Unless the
contrary is stated, the MSS. which are noticed are to be taken as copies.
The term transcriptis used to denote a copy later in date than the fifteenth
century. In the lists of MSS. the several manuscripts are usually entered
in the order in which they were examined. But where an original existe,

Ξ it is noted first in order3 and the editor has distinguished markedly
inferior copies or editions as ‘defective ’ or ‘ inaccurate '.
