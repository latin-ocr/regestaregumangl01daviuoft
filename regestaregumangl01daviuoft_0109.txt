document is a clumsy forgery, as William Bp. of Llandaff held that see from 1185

to 1191.

Gloucester‚ at the request of Abbot Serlo.

Dated ‘ Anno Incarnationis Domini millesimo octogesimo sexto '. The form is suspici ous
and resembles that of a preceding 61161161· (No. 167). These lands of Abp. Thomas

with a spurious confirmation, attributed to Stephen and dated 1138 (Cart. i. 122).
