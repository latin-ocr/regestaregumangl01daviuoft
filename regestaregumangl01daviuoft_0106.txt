208, * Grant (spurious) by Robert Count of Mortain to the monks of St.
Michael de Periculo Maris,

Of Michael's Mount in CornwalL With half a hide of land, to hold as freely
as he used to hold it. By the King's licence the monks may have there
a weekly market on Thursdays. Afterwards, having been vouchsafed through
St. Michael's aid a son born of his lawful wife, he has given further lands in
AJnaneth and Travelaboth with the leave of King William, Queen Matilda,
and their sons Count Robert, William Rufus, so freely that the monks shall be
free from the King's justice in all matters except homicide.

E 209, Notification by William I to S[weyn] the sheriff and the lieges of
sseX.

That he has granted St. Peter of Westminster the land and marsh of
[East] Tilbury which Geoffrey de Mandeville gave the said church for the

soul of his wife who lies there.
Witnesses: Richard, son of Count Gilbert3 R[obert] de Oilli.

Sweyn, who appears as 3 tenant-in-chief in 1086, had ceased by that date to hold the
sheriffdom. This grant would seem to have been frustrated. No part of Tilbury is
entered in Domesday as belonging to westminster Abbey. It appears from D. B. ii.
59 b that Geoffrey claimed against Sweyn thirty acres which the latter had added to
his manor of [West] Tilbury. See Round in V. C. H. Εεεεεε, 1. 374, 508.
