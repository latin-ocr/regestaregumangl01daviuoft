justiciar.¹ We have two chartei-s in which William fitz Osbern seems to
hold the position of a justiciar in Worcestershire and Grloucestershire‚2 and

another (possibly spurious) giving him the same position in Oxfordshire.3

of their earldoms 3 which may be taken as an additional proof of the palatine
character of their dignity.⁴ But Odo of Bayeux was not on the same footing
in Kent. William I and William II address their writs both to Odo and
to Hamo the Sheriffi⁵ This looks as though Kent ought to be deleted from
the list of palatine earldoms. Oornwass, which may have been held by
Robert of Mortain as a palatinate‚ had certainly lost thatc haracter by 1096,6
when it was held by 6 165761 sheriff and experienced a visitation from itinerant
justices. On the other hand, it seems to be only in 1095 that the Bishopric
of Durham acquires 6 fully palatine 61161661361.7

ᾧ28. Τ11616 616 frequent references in the charters to 13116 105761 forest—
rights, but our information as to the local machinery 1057 which these rights
were guarded is very defective. Under William II the king’s foresters
appear 130 166 used for this purpose. He forbids them to meddle with the
lands of Ramsey, m'sz' de bestiis et de essartis.⁸ The phrase suggests that
they had authority 136 investigate and to punish cases of essarting. About
1094 Croc, the huntsman, is ordered to quit-claim the Α1016613 of Malmesbury
of a plea which he had instituted for the sum of 608. 3 it does not appear in
what court the plea had been 1613611.ῃ One writ, however, of the Conqueror
suggests that the forest law was administered by the shire-court. It is
addressed to the Kentish shire-court and orders an inquiry into alleged
trespasses upon the hunting rights of Battle Abbey. The shire-court is to
do justice as it would against transgressors caught on the royal demesne.¹⁰
That the English and Norman forest-systems were very similar is suggested
by several charterS.¹¹ It is interesting to find that in a charter of William I
the special hunting rights of the Londoners are implicitly recognized ; ¹² but
there is nothing to show upon what title these rights were exercised.
Grants of free hunting are few in number3 even the right of free warren is
sparingly granted.¹³

§29. Missi Dominici. Occasionally the king adopted the expedient of
sending down to a 311116 61 group of shires one or more commissioners who
were instructed to hear local pleas 61 to investigate questions which concerned
the interests of the Crown. Sometimes the instructions issued to these
commissioners were of 6 general character. Under William Ι and
William ΙΙ we have at least three cases of itinerant justices holding an iter
such as we afterwards find taking place under Henry I and Henry II.14 The
Domesday commissioners are the most important of those who were sent
out to investigate domanial rights. But we also find commissioners
