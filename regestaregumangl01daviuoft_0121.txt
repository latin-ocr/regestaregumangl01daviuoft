271, * Mandate (spurious) by William I to S[2 Gausbcrtus] Abbot of Battle. [lon-87]

Not to grant any part of the Zeuya lying round the church of Battle—-‘ quam
in memoriam Normannorum victorie extendi mensura Normannice leuge con-
stitui '—as an hereditary estate, but to grant it with the counsel of 13116 monks
to his men at a rent. ‘ Notificatum enim est michi quod famulis tuis quos
[ed. quod] tecum adduxisti partem plurimam predicte leuge in feudo dedisti,
quod omnino defendo, et ut irritum fiat super forisfacturam meam jubeo 116
libertatem, quam eidem ecclesie concessi, destrui ab aliquibus contingat.
Nunc ergo me ad Normanniam transeunte, predictam leugam sicut tibi tradidi
liberam et quietam constitue3 quia cum ad. Angliam, Deo favente, rediero,
per vos transibo 61, qualiter nostra ecclesia 6113 constructa et ordinata videbo, et
si ea quae nunc tibi mando interim implere distuleris, ego per me eandem
ecclesiam a servorum dominatione sicut meam dominicam capellam, deo
auxiliante, liberabo, et tibi sicut rebelli michique resistenti dignam vindictam
recom ensab0.'

Witiiesses: W. Bp. of Durham3 Haimo, Dccpifhr3 Ivo Taillebois.

bert and William Bp. of Durham and his successors.

Of Welton (co. Yorks.) with its appurtenances, With 606 and sac and all the
customs thereto pertaining‚ to hold as well and quietly as 13116 said Confessor

holds his other lands.

Stevenson‚ Liber Vitae (Surtees Soc. 1841), p. 76.]
The above date is given on the assumption that the Liber Vitae is correct in making this
a grant to Bp. William. But the Liber Rubeus (666 Ηῖετ. Dzmelm. Scriptt. Tres,
p. ccccxxiv ff.‚ makes Bp. Walcher the recipient of the grant. Welton appears in
D. B. 66 belonging to the Bp. of Durham (i. 30412). Simeon of Durham makes
Bp. William the recipient. Cf. No. 231, supra.

273. *Notification (spurious), (‘notum sit omnibus tam praesentibus quam [1071-87.]
futuris ⁹), by William I, generally addressed.

That, having inspected the charters of the church of Glastonbury, he grants
to that church for ever certain lands claimed as belonging thereto by heredi-
tary right: viz. Middleton [co. somerset} Fulebroc‚ Berwes co. Somerseq,
Burmigton [co. Hants} Lime [Uplyme‚ co. Devon], Blakeford co. Somerset
Witone [60. 8011161661]

Witnesses: W. Bp. of Durham3 Lanfranc Abp. [of Canterbury]; Thomas
Abp. [of York]; Walkelin Bp. [of Winchester]; Robert Count of Mortain
(Mauro).

[Bodleian‚ MS. Ashmole 790, fo. 105 (copy).

Monasticon, i. 27.] ἱ .

Α charter of Henry I to Glastonbury (Monasticon, No. 44) mentions a charter by which
his father confirmed the places above-named to that church. The document before
us may therefore be a clumsy attempt to reconstruct a lost charter. Fulebroc,
Berwea and. Burmigton are not catalogued among the abbey's possessmns m
Domesday.
