IN TRODUCTION xvii

the son of Isabella, daughter of Duke Robert, by Henry Count (1) of Se‘ezst
Ι have found no trace of his parents in the earlier sources. His honourable
career as Bishop of Salisbury suggests that he owed his appointment to
other qualities than those of the self-made official. His character is com-
mended even by the critical William of Malmesbury, to whom he seemed
vir probatissimus . . . ambitionis immunis.² He followed Hermann as Bishop
of Salisbury3 the exact date of his appointment is uncertain, but he was in
possession of the see and duly consecrated before Pentecost‚ 1078, when he
took part in the translation of St. Aldhelm.3 He appears to have remained
chancellor for some time after his promotion‚ if we are correct in our
restoration of the text of a charter calendared below!² Some critics have
assigned the charter in question to the reign of Henry Ι, supposing that
the chancellor in question is Roger of Salisbury and William the king’s
son is William Atheling. This, however, is a chronological impossibility;
for Roger had ceased to act as chancellor long before William Atheling
was capable of acting in his father’ s stead.

By the year 1082 at latest the chancellorship had been transferred from
the hands of Osmund to those of Maurice.⁵ Maurice held property in
Normandy and appears as a benefactor of the nuns of St. Amand 3 6 110 was
also archdeacon of Le Mans.⁷ We are therefore justified in regarding him
as a foreigner. Unlike Osmund he was a man of worldly character, although
by Orderic he is complimented with the epithets bonus et reliyiosus.8 Like
Ranulf Flambard, who first appears in history as his protege? he belongs
to the class of cathedral-building bishops; he burdened his see with debts
to make St. Paul's the wonder of contemporaries. But he was a loose liver
and an efficient rather than a reputable bishop.1⁰ Maurice was appointed to
the see of London at the Ohristmas court of 1085. But his consecration
took place not earlier than Aug. 20, 1086,11 and he may have continued to

act as chancellor in the interval.
ξ 11. It is occasionally asserted that Maurice resigned the chancellorship

some time before his appointment to London, and that the office then
passed to William de Bello Fago, who held it until he was promoted
(Christmas, 1085) to the see of Thetford. This statement appears to be
based on the evidence of two Durham charters,12 attested by William the
king's chancellor and Maurice the Ohaplain, which profess to belong to the
year 1084. Ι agree with Canon Grreenwell13 in regarding these as forgeries
of the next century. Leaving other arguments on one side, it would be
unheard of that Maurice, after acting as chancellor‚ should revert to the
position of a simple chaplain and serve under one who had formerly been
his inferior. If any successor were formally appointed after the promotion
of Maurice, it is probable that the honour fell to Robert Bloet. He was one
of the Conqueror's chaplains in 1087 ; and he was commissioned to deliver
