316. 3660111 01 611 inquest taken by Robert Duke 01 Normandy and WilliamII
King 01 England‚ at Caen, through their bishops and barons.

Concerning the rights of jurisdiction which William I had in Normandy.
These are enumerated in fourteen sections. The jurors found that the duke
had jurisdiction whenever men resorting to his court or to the host were
injured (ξξ 1-3) and when fortifications 01 castles were made without
licence (ξ 4). He might take any castle into his own hand (ξ 4) or take the
6011 01 brother 01 grandson (nepotem) 01 6 baron as a hostage, 11 not 01 knightly
rank (ᾧ 5). He might punish those who harried or plundered (ᾧ 6), 01 committed
a breach 01 the peace in the duke's forests (ᾧ 7), 01 made war on 611 enemy,
01 mutilated 6 1766661 except by lawful judgement (ᾧ 8). No one in Nor-
mandy might commit haufare or arsen or rape or take a distress without
an appeal being admitted to the lord who ought to take cognizance thereos (ξ 9).
Over such offences the Duke had jurisdiction in some places and his barons
in others (ξ 10). No one might molest a merchant in Normandy, except 101·
6 debt 01 suretyship (ᾧ 11). ΝΟ 111611 might molest 6 foreigner 011 account
01 any previous trespass; whoever did so, his life was in the Duke's mercy (ᾧ 12).
No one might make money, good or bad, outside the mints 01 3011611 and

Bayeux (ᾧ 13). No one might take 6 111611 prisoner or hold him to ransom on ι

account 01 6 private war (ζ) 14). The King and the Duke have other rights also, ἶ

which are not written down in this record, and which shall not be treated as 3
null because not mentioned here. ’
