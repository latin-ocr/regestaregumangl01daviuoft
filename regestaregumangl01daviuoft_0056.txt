Matilda was not in England at Christmas‚ 1067. These witnesses are witnesses to the

confirmation, not to the original grant. They should be compared with those of the
chal-ter to Giso of Wells [No. 23]. Τ116 cardinals John and Peter did not visit

England till 1070 ; by that time Abp. Aldred was dead, and Michael the chaplain was .

Bp. of Avranches. See further on the date J. H. Round, Commune of London, p. 30 ff.
The editor of the charter (Mr. Stevenson) accepts it as genuine iu toto. But the long
list of judicial privileges has a suspicions air, and may be a later addition, like the
names 01 the cardinals. To a small extent the evidence of D. B. confirms that of
the charter. Good Easter is entered (ΠΒ. 11. 20) 65 belonging to St. Martin’s
by the gift of Count Eustace; Mashbury is perhaps the berewick appurtenant to
Good Easter which the count retained in his own hand. Maldon (ii. 29) 61111
Tolleshunt (ii. 32) are entered as grants from Count Eustace. Benfleet manor and
church belonged to Westminster Abbey by the gift of King William ; but the survey
records as the property of St. Martin the hide in Benfleet which is named in this
charter: ‘ octavam hidam de eadem ecclesia Sanctae Mariae dedit Ingelricus Sancto
Martium et adhuc ibi est ut consulatus testatur sine iussu regis.' This seems to
mean that St. Martin could show no charter for the hide in Benfleet, and casts
a doubt on the details of the grant which the charter 16001015. Most of the other
places mentioned in this charter appear in D. B. as the property of Count Eustace.

He may have ignored the King's confirmation of Ingelric's grants. But it is also 'j

poggibl? (that the King's confirmation was far less comprehensive than is here re-
presen e .
