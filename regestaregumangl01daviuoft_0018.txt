xii INTRODUCTION

we possess no less than four different writs relating to such a simple
matter as the appointment of a new bishop of Wells.1 How many were
needed 011 such occasions as the accession of a new sovereign, the pro-
clamation of a treaty, or the reconciliation of great rebels to the Crown?
We can only gueSS. since we do not possess the archives of any Old English
noble family, and since ecclesiastical houses only preserved those writs and
charters which related 1ο their own estates, All we can say is that the
king’s chaplains were a hard-worked body, and that the chapel was an
essential link between the Crown and its local representatives.

{⁸3- The personnel of the royal chapel is better known to us than its
organization. It contained, in the years 1016-1066, a foreign clement
which is large enough to suggest that Cnut and the Confessor had special
reasons for desii-ing the service of continental clerks. Thus Duduc, after-
wards Bishop of Wells (1033), was either a Saxon or a Lotharingian32
Hermann, promoted to the see of Ramsbury in 1045, was a Lotharingian;
Leofric, who obtained the see of Crediton in 1046, though a ‘Briton' by
birth, had been educated in Lotharingia.3 Lotharingians also were (Eliso,
who succeeded Duduc at Wells in 1050,·² and Alberic, who figures in
Domesday Book. U1f‚ whose appointment 10 Dorchester caused so much
scandaL and William, who received the see of London in 1051, were both
Normans.⁵ Baldwin‚ promoted in 1065 to the abbacy of St. Edmunds,
had been a monk of St. Denis and was presumably of French or Lotharin-
gian origin.⁶ Helinandus, employed by the Confessor as an envoy to
Henry 1 of France, was a native of Ponthieu.⁷ It is obvious that such
foreigners would be more useful than Englishmen in diplomatic work,
and others besides Helinandus were thus employed. But diplomatic
negotiations were comparatively infrequent, and hardly of sufficient
importance to account for the rewards which some of these aliens received.
Why were their services so highly valued‘? Not always because of the
saintly example which they 301 before the English clergy. Ulf of Dor-
chester, as every reader of the Chronicle will remember, ‘did naught
bishop-like, so that we are ashamed to tell more of what he did.' ⁸ Some,
such as William of London, commanded universal respect, and may have
been secretaries, impliciti soeculo, by mere accident. Others, however, came

Cnut and the Confessor 301 themselves to create a chancery of the con-
tinental type; that the Lotharingian priests of Cnut brought with them
some knowledge of the routine of Imperial administration3 and that the
Norinans employed by the Confessor similarly introduced a part of French
or Norman methods.⁰ If there be any truth in these hypotheses, it must
