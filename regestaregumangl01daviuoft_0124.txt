WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR

283, Notification by William I to T. the sheriff and all the sheriffs in the
bishopric of Bp. Remigius.

By the authority and advice of Pope Alexander and his legates and
Abp. Lanfranc and the bishops of the kingdom, the King has transferred the
see 01 Dorchester to the city of Lincoln. He has given a site for the church
in that city, making it free of all customs. He has also given the manors of
Welton and Sleaf0rd3 1116 churches of Kirkton‚ Castor, and Wellinghore,
with their lands and tithes. Also the tithes of the said manors; also the
churches of St. Lawrence and St. Martin in Lincoln. Also the manor 01
Lestona [co. Beds] which Earl Waltheof long ago gave to Bp. Remigius
by the King's hand3 and another called Waburna which the King himself
gave 10 Remigius with his pastoral staff. Also the four churches of Bedford‚
Lestona‚ Buckingham‚ Aylesbury, which his predecessors held and which the
King has already confirmed 10 him.

Witnesses: L[anfranc] Abp. [of Canterbury]; E. the sheriff.

T. is probably Turold, the grandfather of William of Roumare. ·

The Bishop did not receive the whole manor of Lestona, but only an estate of four hides
within the manor (D. B. i. 209). Welton and Sleaford and Waburna were his
(ib. i. 144, 344, 344 b) ; so were two churches in Lincoln (i. 336). Ι11 1086 116 claimed
the churches of Castor (i. 338 b), of Bedford (i. 210 b), Aylesbury and Buckingham
(i. 143). In Wellinghore the church is entered as belonging to St. Peter of Lincoln,
the manor as terra reye's (D. B. i. 337 b). If this 61161161· be genuine, we 11111316οη-
clude either that it was issued after the Domesday Survey, or that the King had
not fulfilled his promises. The use of the word dudum in reference to the gifts
of Lestona and Waburna makes it probable that the grant dates from the later years
of the reign.

284, Notification by William to W[alkelin] Bp. [01 Winchester] and
H[ugh] de Port and all of Hants.

That he has restored to Thomas Abp. of York a hide of land pertaining
to the church of Motesfunda, to hold as well as Abp. Aldred held it in the
time 01 King Edward, with rights of common 01 pasture for so many beasts
as could be kept there in the time 01 King Edward3 63 was testified before
the Bp. of Durham and Bertram de Verdun, and defined (divisum) by the men
of the shire.

Witnesses: W[illiam] Bp. of Durham 3 Bertram de Verdun.

cf. D. B. i. 42 (Η61113); ‘ Thomas Archiepiscopus tenet in manerio de Mortesfunde unam
aecclesiam et VI capellas. . . . Huic aecclesiae pertinent v hidae una virgata minus . . .
De his v hidis abstulerunt prepositi regis 1 hidam . . . sicut dicit hundret. Hoc
fecit Caua prepositus nesciente Hugone de Port.‘

Before the names of the witnesses comes the valediction, Valete. Also there is, at fo. 63 '

of the Liber Albus, a third copy giving 6 different attesting clause: ‘teste ipso rege
et archiepiscopo Thoma et S. (ἱ) G.) Cancellario.‘ Probably in both copies the
witnesses are 6 copyist's addition.
