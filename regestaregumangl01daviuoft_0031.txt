Dr. Round has proved (G. de M . 180). Η6 seems to have been sheriff of Suffolk
at an early date in the reign.¹ The bulk of his manors lay in that shire
and, as he rarely appears in the charters of William I, we may conclude
that he was chiefly occupied with local administration. He is a striking
instance of a great household officer who does not appear in the charters
under his official title. He seems to have retained his office under William II
and Henry I, but espoused the cause of Duke Robert and was banished
from England before the battle of Τ111011611161.2

AIULF appears as sheriff of Dorset under William Ι, but had vacated the
office by 1086.3 111 1091 116 6116313 with the title of sheriff, but it was in
Somerset that he held this office under William 115³ It is probable that he
acted as Deputy Chamberlain ⁵ to Robert Malet3 for part of Aiulf's lands
lay in the manor of Lulworth⁷ and in the time of Henry Ι there were
Lulworth lands attaching to the Deputy Chamberlainship.

AUBREY, who attests a Lessay charter ⁰ in 1084, with the style of chamber—
lain, is probably Aubrey I de Vere, the father or grandfather of the Great
Chamberlain of Henry I. Aubrey Ι held great estates in Essem, Suffoffi.
and Cambridgeshire‚ but is otherwise an inconspicuous figure in history.
He is perhaps the same Aubrey who appears as a benefactor to Thorney
Abbey in a charter which falls in the years 1085-1112.τ

HERBERT attests no charters of William I or William 11, but his official
title is given in Domesday Book. He is called by the Abingdon historian s
‘ regis cubicularius et thesaurarius ’. If he really combined these functions,
he illustrates the original connexion between the Camera Regis and the
treasury. Dr. Round compares his position to that of the keeper of the
Privy Purse.

RAmARD, apparently a Norman, was succeeded, in the office of chamber-
lain, by his son CORBEL, not later than 1082.9

RALPH attests two Norman charters in 1066.¹0 His son,W11.1.1AM Firz
Ram, attests as chamberlain a Caen charter of 1082.11 After the death
of William I he appears in the service of Duke Robert.¹2 His office therefore
is plainly Nor-man rather than English.

OUEN appears as a justice in the Curia Ducis of Normandy in 1085.13

HUMFREY was in 1086 a tenant in chief of lands in eight English shires.
Some Suffolk lands had passed to him from Robert Malet, the Great
(311611111611611134 but in what manner is not stated. Humfrey attests a
charter of William Ι which is not earlier than 1078.15 In two charters of
William II he is addressed as holding some official position (either as
sheriff or as justiciar) in Suffolk.1⁰ He may have been a chamberlain
of Queen Matilda‚ since some of his Surrey lands were held by her grant.

Osnmm the chamberlain is named in a Westminster charter of 107 6-82.
He had possessed a house in London. The name is a common one3 but
