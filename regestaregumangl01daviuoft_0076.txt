WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR

Countess (at the abbey of Troarn) as occurring on Dec. 5 (ii. 411). In a later passage
(ii. 432) he says that it occurred during a visit paid by William Pantulf to Robert
Guiscard. This visit occurred in 1077-8. To one or other of these years, probably
to 1077, we should refer the murder of the countess.
