JUSTIGE AND ADMINISTRATION IN THE CHARTERS.

5³23· The Justieiars. Whether there was, under the first two Norman
kings, a Chief Justiciar who acted as the king's lieutenant in judicaturo
and administmtion, is a question which the charters leave uncertain. The
chroniclers may be cited as pointing to an affirmative answer. But most
of their statements are questionable. William of Malmesbury affirms that
Odo of Bayeux was totius Anylz’ae vicedominus sub φερε . . . post necem
W illelmi filie· Osberte'.¹ William apparently thinks that these two received
in 1067 something more than ‘a temporary commission to govern England
in the king’s absence. For the early months of the reign of William Rufus
we have conflicting testimonies. Henry of Huntingdon states that Bishop
Odo acted for his nephew as justitiarius et princeps totius Anyliae 3 ² while
William of Malmesbury states that the administration was in the hands of
William Bishop of Durliam.3 Both writers seem to rely upon the same
passage of the Peterborough Chronicle 4—an ambiguous passage which seems
to refer to Odo of Bayeux, but which does not mention the justiciarship.
Lastly‚ we have Orderic’s statement that Ranulf Flambard was, at a later
period, summus reyiarum procurator opum etjustitz'arius.⁵

It is clear from the charters that William Ι commonly appointed one or
more J usticiars to govern England when he was in Normandy. The number
of persons so appointed at one time appears to have varied. Lanfranc, who
§vas appointed to the office with great regularity‚ sometimes acted alone,
as in the year 1075, for which by a stroke of good fortune we possess some
important extracts from his official correspondence.6 Odo of Bayeux may
have been acting as sole justiciar in the year 1080.7 Both he and Grosfrid
of Coutances appear in other charters as co-justiciars with Lanfran0.8 Of
laymen the following appear on various occasions : Robert of En, Robert of
Mortain,9 Richard fitz Grilbert‚¹⁰ Roger of Montgomeri,11 Hugh ofMontfort‚1'2
William of Warenne.13 The first three were related to William 13 Earl
Roger and William ofWarenne were his persona] friends ; Hugh of Montfort
was Chief Constable of Normandy. It seems clear that both prelates and
laymen were chosen for the office on personal grounds, In the reign of
William II we find few references to such justiciars. RanulfFlambard acts
both before and after his promotion to the see of Durham314 Bishop Ralf
of Chichester occurs once only.¹⁶ Hamo Dapifer (the younger) and Urse of
Abit6t are the only laymen specified as holding the office.¹⁶

3324. Judyes of the Curia Reyis. A certain number of our documents
relate to judicia] sessions of the Curia Regis3 and some of these give lists
of judges. The official theory was that the Curia consisted of the prelatas,
earls, and barons.¹7 In 1086 we find the king trying a private law-suit with
