the assistance of his sons William and Henry‚ the two archbishops‚ eight
bishops‚ two abbotS, two counts, one earl and eighteen barons.1 Another
case, heard in Normandy but relating to English land, is heard by three
laymen—the Count of Meulan‚ Eudo Dapzfer, and William fitz Oger—and
the Chancellor William Giffard and one chaplain‚ William Warelwast.²
In this case, the king not being present, we find a semi-professional court
at work.

Concerning the ducal court in Normandy we have more evidence. About
1076 it sits under the presidency of the Bishop of Coutances3 it included
many of the nobles of the land, but three laymen are specially mentioned
as taking part in the judgement. They are Ranulf the vicomte, Neel fitz NeeL
and Robert de Vipont.3 On another occasion judgement is given by the
Archbishop of Rouen, by Roger of Beaumont, and by many other barons.4
A suit between two abbots in 1080 is tried by a court of ecclesiastice
consisting of the Archbishop of Rouen, the Bishop of Evreux and four abbots⁵
In the same year a suit between the Holy Trinity, Rouen, and the Bishop
of Evreux is tried by all the prelates and barons who were assembled for
the Easter court. Among those present are named the Archbishops of Bourges
and Vienne.6 Again‚ about 1080 we find the Duke deputing the Bishops of
Coutances and Lisieux and Eudo the vicomte to try a suit.7

In 1085 a suit between the Abbey of Fecamp and a layman is decided by
two Norman abbots and five laymen. The names of the latter are Roger
de Ivri the Butler, Hugh de Port‚ Wido Oillei‚ Richard de Courcy, and
Geoffrey Martel.8

ᾧ 25. Locaz Administration. References to sessions of the shire-court are
tolerably numerous in the charters. Under the Norman kings the evidence
of the shire—court was constantly taken on questions of title—sometimes by
the sheriff,⁹ sometimes by commissioners appointed for the purpose.¹⁰ Where
the property in question was distributed over several shires, a joint session
of the shire-courts was sometimes held, as in the year 1080, when the shires
of Cambridge, Essex‚ Hertford, and Huntingdon gave evidence at Keneteford

’ respecting the liberties of Ely Abbey. The four shires were represented on

 

this occasion by some great tenants in chief and many knights.11 Three
sheriffs appeared in person and those of Norfolk and Suffolk by deputy.
Under William II we find a similar assembly held for the benefit of Ramsey
Abbey3 in this case it is convened by the Sheriff of Huntingdonshire acting
under a royal mandate.12

As to the composition of the shire-court and hundred-court we have an
interesting clue in a writ of William Π for Abbot Baldwin of Bury. The
men of the abbey shall not be constrained to attend the courts of shire and
hundred unless they held so much land that they were shire-worthy or
hundred-worthy in the time of King Edward.13 This suggests that the duty
of attending depended on the possession of a certain holding. This document
