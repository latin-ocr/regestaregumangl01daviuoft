He 6116313 with four other chaplains a record of a suit held in Normandy
on Sept. 5, 1082 (Calendar, 146 α). He also attests a charter to St. Stephen
of Caen between 1079 and 1082(061611(161, 168). Our evidence, therefore,
connects him closely with the Norman chancery.

GILBERT ΜΑΜΙΝΟΤ, chaplain and physician of William Ι (Orderic, ii. 311),
attests a Norman charter of 1067 (0616110161, 6αψ), and his name is placed
before that of his colleague Rainald the Younger3 but in 1068 116 ranks
after Michael (Calendar, 22). His name also occurs in a dubious charter to
St. Augustine's, Canterbury3 which if genuine would seem to belong to the
year 1070 (Calendar, 39). He was subsequently J‘promoted to the see of
Lisieux (1077).1

GONTARD became a monk at St. Wandrille between 1066 and 1078
(Calendar‚ 110). He held four English churches which passed to St. Wan—
drille. He finally became Abbot of J umieges.

[HENRY appears as witness to a charter of 1080—6 in favour of St. Pancras
of Lewes (Calendar, 232). He is not given the title of chaplain 3 but unless
he held 11161 rank 116 would hardly be designated by his Christian name
alone. It is possible that he should be identified with 1116 Henry who
attests, 63 6 chaplain of Queen Matilda, a charter in favour of J umieges
(Calendar, 193).]

HERBERT LOSINGA, afterwards Prior of Fecamp‚ Abbot of Ramsey and
Bishop of Norwich, is given by Orderic as an example of a royal chaplain
who obtained high promotion (Orderic‚ iv, p. 11). If Orderic's statement
13 0011601, Herbert must have been a chaplain of 1116 Conqueron For he
obtained Ramsey Abbey in 1087, and his appointment to Fecamp falls still
earlier.

INGELRIO, of whom we have already spoken (supra, p. xvi), attests royal
charters in the years 1067—9.

J OHN DE VILLULA, 6 native of Tours‚ is expressly named as a chaplain
by Orderic (iv. 11), but seems to have owed his position in the chapel,
like Baldwin of Bury 81. Edmunds, Gilbert Maminot and Faritius of
Abingdon, to his skill in medicine. He attests (as Bishop of Β6111) 6 spurious
Durham charter attributed to William I (Calendar‚ 286), but does not occur
in the genuine documents of the reign.

MrcHAEL‚ afterwards Bishop of Avranches (1067), stands next to Hei-fast
the Chancellor in the foundation-charter of St. Martin le Grand. He was
an Italian by birth and famous for his learning (Orderic‚ ii. 171).

[Ono attests a charter of 1083 111 favour of the Holy Trinity at ann
(Calendar, 182). But apparently he, like Henry (q. v.)‚ was a Queen's
chaplain, who only attested William’s charters by accident (Calendar, 193).
There 13 6 mention, in another charter to J umieges by William 1, of a chap-
} lain odo who held land in England Τ. R. E. (Calendar, 194). This suggests
the possibility that Queen Matilda had taken over the surviving chaplains
of Queen Edith‚ and makes an addition to the list of Normans resident

in England before the Conquest]

character sketch.
