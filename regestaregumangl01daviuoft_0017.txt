IN TRODUOTION

THE OLD ENGLrsn CHANCERY.

ξ 1. Τ116 West-Saxon kings of the tenth century must have maintained
a staff of clerks to draft their charters and 130 make official copies of their
ordinances. The charters of Athelstan and his successors are highly
technical compositione, framed on a set plan and constantly using stereo-
typed formulas.¹ That a copy of every new law was transmitted to each
shire-moot, we learn from the well-known letter of the Kentish 311116-
moot to King Athelstan‚ which acknowledges the receipt of such a com-
munication32 and it is probable that hundred-moots and individuals of
local importance were kept in touch with the resolutioris of the Witan by
such means. For our earliest copies of Old English laws are contained
in books which belonged to ecclesiastica] foundations3 and we know of
one case in which Edgar commanded that many copies of certain enact-
ments should be sent to the aldermen of Mercia and East Anglia, to be
distributed within their jurisdictions.3 On the Continent, in states of
Frankish origin, the secretarial work which such a system of promulga-
tion implies was performed by the court chaplains. It is probable that
the case was the same in Wessex‚ at least from the days of Edward the
Elder. His charters are regularly attested by a small number of presbytem,
some at least of whom were in 'regular attendance 011 1113 person. These
‘king’s priests' have become, by the time of Onut, a numerous and highly
favoured body‚4 from whose ranks it is usual to nominate bishops and
abbots. Upwards of a dozen bishoprics fell to king’s priests in the days of
Cnut and Edward the Confessor.5 Such rewards to royal chaplains are not
without earlier precedents. In 678 13116 366 of Lindsey had been given to
a chaplain of the Northumbrian court,G and about 956 a priest of King
Eadwig received a 111311011110.7 But the promotion of king's priests became
a policy in the last half-century of the &Vest-Saxon state, and it suggests
that the secretarial work of the chaplains was increasing in importance.

ξ 2. Τ1113 13 only what we should expect. It is partly to be explained by
the introduction of the formal writ. From the earliest years of Cnut it
was the practice to notify appoffltments, gifts, and judicial decisions by
means of these official circulars to all the shire-courts and all the magnates
affected. Only a small number of these writs has been preserved. But
we may infer, from the salutations which they contain, that each of them
was issued at least in duplicate or triplicate. And it is significant that
