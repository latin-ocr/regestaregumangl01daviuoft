xxxii INTRODUCTION

appointed for less important and more limited purposes‚ to hear a particular
suit, or to take an inventory of particular lands. Thus, at some date between
1077 and 1086, the Bishop of Coutances was sent into Worcestershire to
hear a suit between Bishop Wulfstan and Abbot Walter of Evesham. He
took the testimony of the shire-court on the subject-‚3 with him were
associated two local magnates—the sheriff, Urse of Abitot, and Osbern son
of Escrop.¹ At some date before 1082 the lands of Ely were enrolled by the
Bishops of WVinchester and Coutances, acting on the evidence of sworn
jurors.2 WVhen William Π granted a site in Norwich to Bishop Herbert
Losinga for the erection of a cathedraL he caused the lands in question to
be viewed by Roger Bigot, the Bishop of Winchester, and Ranulf Flambard,
the Chaplain.3 Again, an estate granted to Eudo Dapifer is viewed by a
commission of three laymen—Geoffrey de Mandeville, Haimo Dapzfer, and
Ranulf brother of Ilger.‘1 The need for such special inquisitions was lessened
by the Domesday survey. Already under William II we find that the
returns (breves) of 1086 are cited as evidence of title.⁵

ξ 30. The complexity of local administration was much increased by the
immunities of private estates. But it is difficult to generalize concerning
the judicial and fisca] privileges of the lay landowner. A glance at our
index of grantees will show how few are the charters to laymen which have
survived 3 and even in these the references to judicial and fiscal privileges
are vague. But we have some indications that these privileges were granted
on fixed principles. The considerable landowner, whether a tenant in chief
or a mesne tenant, appears to have had rights of sac and soc with or without
the three supplementary privileges of toll, team, and infangthiefi⁶ This
jurisdiction also belonged to religious houses almost, if not quite, as a matter
of course.⁷ But religious houses had other immunities, fixed in accordance
with customary principles. There was one standard of privileges for a royal
foundation3 another for a private foundation made with the king’s licence.8
It would appear, from a charter granted by William II to St. Stephen of
Caen‚ that the privileges of a royal foundation were identical with those of
manors on the royal demesne.⁹ A long list can be made of immunities
which are specified in the charters of particular foundations. Many of these
immunities are shown by their names to be Old English in origin3 and the

charters of William I and William Π rarely do more than confirm existing .
