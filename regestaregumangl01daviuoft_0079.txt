WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR

[‘Placita de Banco de term. Mich. 34 Ed. 1’; transcript in Bodleian, Dodsworth ΜΞ.
Μὲνῗὲἐιῖἷόηᾞὶ. 1106]

Gontard became Abbot of J umieges in 1078 (Orderic VitaliS, ii. 244, and Prevost's note). In

the Domesday of Dorset (i. 78 b) it is stated: ‘Ecclesia Sancti Wandregisili tenet

ecclesiam de Bridetone et de Brideporte et de Witcerce.' The text of Dodsworth's
transcript is evidently at fault3 for Mincherte we must read Whitchurch. For
Sherston see D. B. i. 65 b: ‘ Sanctus Wandregisibus tenet ecclesiam de Sol-stain.'

111. Notification (bilingual) by William I, addressed generally.

This reads like a conflation of a Latin with an English writ.

King 01 the English, to Fecamp Abbey.

Bereminster appears in D. B. (i. 17), under the name Berie, as belonging to Fecamp. But
see infra the genuine grant of 1085.
