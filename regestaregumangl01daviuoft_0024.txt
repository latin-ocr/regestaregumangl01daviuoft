xviii ΙΝ TROD UCTION

to Archbishop Lanfranc the letter by which the dying king designated
Rufus as heir to the English Crown.¹ But, though Robert Bloet must have
been a chaplain of note to be entrusted with this duty, there seems to be
no definite evidence for placing his appointment to the chancellorship in
the reign of William Ι. We have a charter‚ either of William I or of
William II, which is attested by ‘G. the Chancellor'.2 But this comes to
us through a transcript and it seems clear that the scribe has made a mistake
in the initial.

ξ 12. To conclude, then, we have the following list of chancellors for the
reign of William I :—

Regenbald, 1067.

Herfast, 1068-70.

[Osbern('?)‚ 1070-52].

Osmund, 1070 or 1072-8 or later.
Maurice, before 1083—5.

[Robert Bloet (?) 1086-7}

The chancellors of William Rufus present little difficulty, and it is only
needful to recapitulate briefly what I have written on the subject elsewhere.³
Rufus had two chancellors only: first, Robert Bloet‚ who was consecrated
Bishop of Lincoln on Feb. 12, 1094; secondly‚ William Giffard‚ who acted
as chancellor until and after the king's death. It is by a mere error that
Waldric has been ranked among the chancellors of the reign. Nor is there
any trustworthy evidence to support the hypothesis that Ranulf Flambard
‘may have been the king's chancellor '.4

ᾧ 13. Τ116 chaplains of the Conqueror do not often witness his charters.
It is quite exceptional to find such a list as that which occurs in the founda-

tion-charter of St. Martin le Grand.⁵ In this case the founder was himself ’

a member of the chancery. It is not infrequent to find the signature of one
or two chaplains3 but there are some important charters which are not
attested even by the chancellor. The following list gives the names of
those chaplains who appear in royal charters or are mentioned by
chroniclers :—-

ALBEmc THE LorHARINGIAN (Calendar, 381: cf. Round, Commune os
L'ondon, pp. 36—8).

BALDWIN became Bishop of Evreux in 1070 (Orderic, ii. 215).

ΒΕΝΕΒΙΟΤ 01· Rom-:N attests in 1080 as Archdeacon 01 Rouen(ca1endar‚
125); 111 1082 as one of a group of Norman chaplains (Calendar‚ 146 a).
Presumably he was attached to the Norman chancery.

ΒΕΒΝΑΒΙ), son OF OspAc. He was a Norman 3 he is styled Archdeacon of
Rouen about the year 1080 (Round, C. D. F. 1212), and he became a monk
of the Holy Trinity at Rouen before 1086 (calendar, 220). Η6 visited
England in 1068, possibly also in 1076 and in 1081 (Calendar‚ 22, 90, 144 *);
in 1068 he attests among the English chaplains. In 1080 he witnesses
a Norman charter, and his name is placed after that of Reginald (q. v.).
