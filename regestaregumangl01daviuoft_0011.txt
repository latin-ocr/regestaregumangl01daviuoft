PREFAOE

THIS is the first of three volumes covering the period of the
Anglo-Norman kings (1066-1154). The second and third volumes
are far advanced, and will shortly 106 111 1116 press. The object of
the series is to give a calendar, chronologically arranged 1 and
critically annotated, of the royal acts of the period, and of some
cognate documents which are valuable for the historian. The first
care of the editor has been to call attention to materials which
illustrate the development of law and institutions. But the interests
of the genealogist and the topographer have not been neglected.
Pains have been taken to record the names of persons, and the
more important names of places, which are mentioned in the docu-
ments. The collection includes charters issued in and for Normandy.
Norman archives have not been searched for the purpose, since the
N orman material is being collected by Professor Haskins. But it
seemed advisable to calendar such Norman charters as have been
printed or are to be found in English manuscripts; for many of
these charters throw useful sidelights upon English history. A few
letters and charters which do not emanate from the royal or ducal
chancery, and which are not even attested by a sovereign, have been
added on account of their intrinsic interest. It seemed best, for
practica] purposeS, to cast a wide net in collecting materials, and to
include any documents which were of obvious historical importance.

The present volume is the shortest of the three. The charters
of William I and William II are relatively few3 and they have
attracted the curiosity of English and French scholars from the
seventeenth century onwards. Stil] there are gleanings of unpub-
lished material to 106 made, even for these reigns. It will be found
that our appendix contains ninety-two 11061111161116, of Which most
are here edited for the first time. The second volume, containing

the charters of Henry I, will be considerably richer in new

¹ In the present volume the order 'is not always strictly chronological; but this is an
accident due to the fact that certain charters could not be finally dated till the whole series
was in print.
