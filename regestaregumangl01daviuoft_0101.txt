The superior limit of date is given by the Worcester document relating to this suit.
The Abbot was not completely successful in asseiting his rights as to Bengeworth.
Domesclay Book (i. 175 b) mentions that one hide in this manor was detained by
Urse of Abetot in spite of the judgement which had been given in the Abbot's favour
by four shireS, assembled under the presidency of Odo of Bayeux.

¹ In a writ of Odo’s which follows the name is given Gildeneberga. In D. B. (i. 175 b) the

name appears as Ildeberga. See Duignan, Place Names of Worcestershire, s. v.

186. Notification by Odo Bp. of Bayeux to Bp. VVulfstan, and Urse and [1079-83·]
Durand and Walter, the sheriffs of Worcestershire and Gloucestershire and
Warwickshire.

That King William has restored to the church of Evesham and Abbot
W[alter] those lands concerning which the Abbot pleaded before seven shires
at Gildenberga [supra‚ No. 185] against all who unjustly claimed them: viz.

Westona co. Glos.]‚ [Upper] Swell [co. Glos.], Bengeworth [cO. Worcester,
Buuntan 00. Worcester]‚ Wixford [co. Warwick], Oldberrow co. Worcesterl,
Kinwarton [co. Warwick], Hillborough [co. Warwick]‚ Ragley co. Warwick].

This did 11οὲ produce its full effect. The Abbot was unable to recover one of the five
hides of Bengeworth (D. B. 1. 175 b). Hillborough was in 1086 111 the hands of Osbern
fitz Richard (ib. i. 244), Westona and Ragley do not appear among the abbey estates
in D. B. Round, V. C. H. Worc. i. 254, regards this document and the preceding as
of doubtful authenticity.

187. Mandate (in Latin and English) by William I to William de Curcello. [ΨΜ-831
To see that the Romfeoh is paid at Michaelmas next by the King's men,

, and by every thane and their men3 and to notify this at Bristol and at
Montacute, that those who have not yet paid may do so3 and to inquire,

both himself and through the Bishop, as to those who have not paid. Neither

the addressee nor his men are to take any pledge ¹ in the land of Bishop Giso,

until the matter has come before the Bishop.

¹ The Latin version reads ‘ mannum ' in error for ‘namium ’. This writ is evidently the
outcome of William's promise to Gregory VII respecting the Romfeoh. On the date see
supra, No. 134. Inferior limit given by W. de Curcello.
