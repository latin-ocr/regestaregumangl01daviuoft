Ga. Charter by William I to the monks of St. Benoit-sur-Loire, concerning
the church of St. J ames de Beuvron,

Relating that, for the safety of the Norman frontier against Brittany, he ἃ

built a castle round the church of St. James de Beuvron, and gave to the

castle many rights which did not pertain to it ‘ videlicet leugam cum sanguine
et teloneo et mercatum de cruce'. By way of compensation and exchange he - ⁵
gave to Abbot Ranulf and the monks of St. Michael two fairs and other granta ·

Then Abbot Hugh and the monks of St. Benoit asked the King to give them

half of what he had granted to the castle. He has accordingly agreed to ¹
a division, of which the particulars are enumerated. The monks are to say ”

a weekly mass for the King, his-wife and sons, and to entertain one monk
for ever in the King's place, and to feed one pauper, and to admit the King 1
to the benefit of all their prayers. j*
