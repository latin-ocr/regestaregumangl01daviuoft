at Lewes (Calendar, 232). It 13, however, doubtful whether the Walter of
the later document should be ranked as a royal chaplain.

WALTER F1rz Go‘rER appears as a chaplain in a Norman document of
1082 (Calendar, 146 a).

WANDEBERT clericus occurs only in a Norman charter of 1073 (0010110101,
70).

WILLIAM DE BELLo FAGo, promoted to the 300 of Thetford in 1085, attests
a Jumieges charter between 1078 and 1083 (Calendar‚ 193). William the
Chaplain, who occurs in forged charters of Durham (Calendar, 148>¹<‚ 195*‚
196*), 111057 00 the same person. In one Durham charter (Calendar, 197*) we
find William occurring both as chaplain and as chancellor (vide supra, p. xvii).

WILLIAM Frrz SUEN attests a Norman document of 1082 (0010110101, 146 a);
in another, of the same or earlier date, he is described as William the
Canon (ib. 168).

WILLIAM BRo'rHER or RAINALD attests the confirmation of his brother’s
grant to Jumieges (Calendar, No. 193), probably in the capacity of a
chaplain.

ξ 14. Τ110 011οΡ101113 of William ΙΙ 010 1111111010113 enough. His charter of
1091 to John, Bishop of Bath, 13 attested by eleven, in addition to the
Chancellor (No. 315). But some of these 010 111010 11011103 to us. Robert
Bloet, William Giffard, and Ranulf Flambard played important parts in
history, the first two as chancellors, the third probably in the Exchequer ;
though 0 well-known story given by Symeon of Durham suggests that he
was custos siyillz· and in this capacity the lieutenant of the chancellor.
Of the remainder, Gerald obtained the see of Hereford, Samson of Bayeux
that of Worcester, Turgis that of Avranches‚ and Turold that of Bayeux.
Ansger, Enguerrand, Herbert, Philip, Tusald 010 known only as attesting
the Bath charter. Others who make an occasional appearance are Ralph
de Bainard (No. 395), Fulcher (Nos. 464, 480).
