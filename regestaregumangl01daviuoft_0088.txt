The chartei· of Edward the confessor is analysed in the Messayer Historique, u. s., p. 243.
This mentions the lVerman-ether (‘? acher) and the huervum, but not the other
commercial privileges here specified.

Dated ‘Anno Dominice Incarnationis MLXXX1'. But Abbot Everelm died in 1069 and
William fitz Osbert in 1073. And Hugh (16 Orival did not become Bp. of London
till 10753 and Maurice was not Chancellor till 1078. Τ1116 charter must therefore

be regarded as spurious.

In Domesday Book (i. 1212) St. Peter of Ghent is entered as holding the manor of
Lewisham (00. Kent) and as having held it T. RE. Henry I refers to a chartei:
of his father confirming Lewisham and Greenwich to St. Peter of Ghent (Round,
C. D. F. No. 1377). The wharf and other commercial privileges mentioned in this
chartei· were in Greenwieh, and are described in the charter of Henry Ι. They
