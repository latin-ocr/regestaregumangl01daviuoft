Robert Bp. of Hereford was appointed in 1079 ; Osmund Bp. of Salisbury in 1078. The

tenth year of William I would end on Dec. 25, or Dec. 31, 1076. The dating clause

but the language and tenor of the charter alike suggest a forgery.

St. Peter's, Westminster, in which are buried King Edward of blessed memory
and Queen Edith of famous memory3 in which also he himself received the
sceptre and crown of all England. By the advice of Abp. Lanfranc and his
barons, he has at length compelled Abbot vitalis, though unwilling, to accept
this office3 since he has much raised the state of the Abbey of Bernay. He
begs his correspondent to approve this choice, and also that of Osbern, brother
of Vitalis, to succeed to the Abbey of Bernay.
