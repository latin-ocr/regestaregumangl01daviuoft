WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR

‘Facta est 1100 donacio in villa que dicitur Wyndesor anno incarnacionis domini mille-
511110 Lxx!

Another grant of the same tenor, but with different witnesses. in the Historia S.
Auqustini (R. S. )‚ p. 348 (infra, No. 39). Cf. D. B. fo. 2 b (Milton) : ‘Ecclesias et decimas
huius manerii tenet abbas S. Augustini et XL solidi de iiij solins regis exeunt ei.‘
But the church of Faversham is not mentioned under Terra Regis or under Terra
Sancti Augustini. This charter is therefore suspicious.

36. N otification by William I to Wulfstan, Bp. 01 Worccster‚a11d W[illiam
fitz Osbert, and all his barons and officials 01 Gloucestershire and Worcester-
shire.

That he has confirmed to God and St. Peter and Abbot Serlo, and the
monks 01 Gloucester, the lands which Abp. Thomas 01 York held unjustly, viz,
East Leach, Oddington, and Standish, with their appurtenances 3 to hold freely
according as it was stated by a jury (recoy‘rvitum) in the King's presence that
the said lands belonged to St. Peter of Gloucester from the beginning, and that
the archbishop had no right in those lands. The lands are to be held with
sac and 500, toll and team and infangthief, and all rights and customs which
the King has granted by his royal power to the said church. No one is to do
in‘gury or wrongf ἓξ 1111ζο 01101ὲοοἓ oz* make any claim, in contravention 01 this
or 01,011 3111 0 0 111 5 or e1 ure. .

Abp. Thomas received the see of York in 1070. William fitz Osbern died abroad in
Feb. 1071. The trial before the King took place most probably at the same date as
the suit between Abp. Thomas and Bp. Wulfstan, in a council held at ‘Pedreda’
late in 1070 (Flor. Wig. s. a.). It appears from this charter that 80110 became abbot
in 1070 or 1071, not in 1072 as stated by the Historia S. Petri Glouc. But perhaps
the charter is a forgery of the first half of the twelfth century. ·

The lands here mentioned are entered in Domesday Book (i. 164 b) as belonging ¹30,AbP·
Thomas, but formerly in the possession of St. Peter of Gloucester. There is *no
reference in D. B. to the lawsuit mentioned in this charter, or to any royal decision
in favour of the abbey. A composition respecting these lands was effected 111 1157
(Gloucester Cart. ii. 105). The Historia S. Petri Glouc. (p. 93) states that Abp. Thomas
restored these lands in 1095 ; and they appear to have been in the possessmn of the
abbey in the first half of the twelfth century.

37. Charter (2 spurious) by William I addressed to all his subjects in England.

Granting to St. Peter 01 the N ew Minster [Winchester] and Abbot Rywallon
the church 01 Alton with five hides 01 land, titheS, &c.; and that 01 [King's]
Clere with 1001 hides and a virgate, tithes, &c To be held as freely as the
site 01 their cemetery which he has received by way 01 exchange (mutuo) from
the abbot as 3 site 101· 1115 11311.

No witnesses or scal, but at the foot a cross roughly drawn. On the question of
authenticity see Birch’s notes, ad loc. The form is French. Date from Liber Vitae, p. 2.

38. Notification (in English language) by William to earls, reeves‚ &c.‚
where Abp. Lanfranc and the convent 01 Christ Church,Canterbury‚ have lands.

That they have sac and soc, toll and theam, grithbryce and hamsoken,
forsteal and infangenthief and fiymenafyrmth, over their own men in burh
and out 01 burh, and over Christ Church and 35 many thegns as the King 1135
allowed them to have.
