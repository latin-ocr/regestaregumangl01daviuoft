Edward's chancellors because a certain Wulfwius cancellarius appears
among the witnesses of a XVestminster charter which bears the date 1045.¹
The authenticity of this document, which is obelized by Kemble, cannot
be defended. But the westminster forgers usually worked with some
knowledge of historica] fact3 they are not 111 the habit of introducing
imaginary personages in their witness-lists; and this particular list agrees
well enough with the date to which the charter is assigned, except that it
antedates Ulf’s appointment, which at the earliest would fall in 1046,
when the death of Lyfing of Worcester and Crediton, who attests the
charter, made possible the promotion of the chancellor Leofric and left his
office vacant. We have 110 charters attested by chaplains between 1045 and
1050. But after Ulf's appointment to Dorchester we are better informed.
First we have a charter dated 1050 which is attested by the presbyters
Robert‚ Godwin, Regenbald, Lyfing, William‚ Brihtric, Unsige and Uinsige.2
Another charter, which bears the date 1054, but is shown by the witness-
list to belong also to the year 1050,3 gives the names of Robert‚ Regenbald,
Godwin, william, Kinsige‚ and Brihtric, William, who appears in 110
charters of later date, is evidently the same who succeeded Robert of
J umieges in the see of London. We may presume that Ulf’s promotion
had left William at the head of the chancery. But who succeeded William‘?
A third list, from another charter of 1050, gives the names of Regenbald,
Robert, Kinsige, and Athelwig3 ⁴ the names of William,Godwin, and Brihtric
have disappeared. Wffliam, we may suppose, was by now designated Bishop
of London3 Godwin may have gone to Rochester, where we find a bishop
of his name in 10583 while Brihtric may be identified with Brihtric prior
and finally (1062) abbot of Malmesbury‚ who in the year 1065 drafted
with his own hand the charter of King Edward to that house.⁵ It
has been sometimes assumed that Regenbald was now the leading figure in
the chancery. This is hard to believe. When the see of York fell vacant
by the death of AElfric Puttuc‚ it was given to Kinsige (1053). Kinsige‚
it is true, was a friend to the house of Godwin3 we afterwards find him
consecrating Harold’s church at Waltham.⁶ But he was also a chancery
clerk of long experience3 he is found attesting a charter of Cnut so early
as 1026,7 and he was the natural person to bring forward in the chancery
during the difficult period of readjustment which followed the return and
pardon of Earl Godwin. From 1053 to 1062 evidence about the chancery
is to seek. But the outstanding chaplain of the period is the Lotharingian
Giso. The little that we know of his life leads us to regard him as a man
of affairs. He had been employed as an envoy to Pope Nicholas3 he was in
high favour with the King and Queen3 he was energetic and successful
in recovering the lands of his see, in rebuilding his cathedral, in organizing
