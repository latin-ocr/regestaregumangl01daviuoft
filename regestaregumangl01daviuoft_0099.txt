This has all bhe marks of a forgery. But the editors of the Monasticon are wrong in
stating that Selby Abbey is unknown to the compilers of Domesday. One of the gifts
of Geoffrey de 16 Wirchi, according to this charter, is Crowle in Lincolnshire. This is
entered among the Lindsey estates of Geoffrey with the note z ‘ nunc quidem abbas de
S. Germano de Salebi habet de Goisfrido ’ (1. 369 b).

Annii-age Robinson, su.s.‚ argues ishat these attestations ‘must be regarded 66 recited in
the writ, which is nob 116611Ί attested, bu‘o ends with Valete'. Such a form would
be unprecedented. The chartei· is 6 clumsy forgery. Ailnod's grant to Westminster
of 13116 land af, Tooting is mentioned in Domesday Book under Tooting (i. 32 b).
