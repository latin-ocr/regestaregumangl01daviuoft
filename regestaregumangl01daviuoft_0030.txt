Dapefe1·.¹ The latter, under the surname Fitz Haimon, plays some partin
political history?

Rima DE Mox'rPINoHoN first attests in 1069, and is styled Dapifer in
a charter of 1080, as also by Orderic Vitalis, to whom we owe some account
of his fa1nily.³ In Domesday Book he is styled simply Ralph Dapzjfer.

S‘rffiAND attests three Norman charters of the years 1067-71.4 Before
the conquest of England‚ as early as 1061, he was already a ducal Dapffer.⁵
Perhaps he should be identified with Stigand of Mesidon whose estates
passed with his daughter to the house of Tancarville.6

Rom-„21³ Bmon is ranked among the Dapz' fers of William I by Mr. Vernon
Harcourt,⁷ but the evidence on which he relies does not prove his point.
He refers to a private charter attested by Roger Dap‘ifer, who may well be
the seneschal of one of the parties concerned,8 and to a Bath charter which
was granted not by William I, but by William ΠΡ Roger Bigod attests
a number of the Conqueror’s charters, but first appears with the style of
Dapzfer under William II. He held the office till his death, in 1107, when
he was succeeded by his son William.

Ivo TAILLEBOIS attests charters of William I, but first appears as Dapzfer
under William II, in 1091. He was dead by the year 1098.10 His heiress
married Roger fitz Gerold,¹¹ who, however, does not appear to have succeeded
to the office of his father-in-law.

GILBERT, who appears as Dapzfer in a single charter of 'William II,12 is
probably Gilbert fitz Richard of Tonbrfflge, who succeeded his father,
Richard de Bienfaite, about 1090. Gilbert fitz Richard does not often
attest the charters of William 113 but we have an original, of the year 1091,
in which he attests between two Dapisera Eudo and Roger Bigot.¹³

WILLIAM, who attests a Bath charter in 1091,14 is possibly identical with
William de Percy who attests immediately after Roger Bigot in an original
charter of the same year.15

[HELTHQ included in the list given by Mr. Vernon Harcourt,¹⁶ appears
under the style of Dapifer as holding from the king in Kent.¹⁷ But he
seems to be identical with the Helto of a later passage, who is a tenant
of Odo of Bayeux¹8 We have also a charter in which Helto appears as

a witness on behalf of Odo.¹⁹ He is probably to be regarded as the bishop’s Α j
dapifer. Similarly ANSFRID, who is addressed as Dapz'fer in a single charter . i
relating to Sandwich (Calendar, 189), is to be identified with a tenant of ᾗ,

Bishop Odo named Ansfrid, who in 1086 held land in sandwicum]

Rossssm MALET, the eldest son of William Malet‚ who succeeded to his z'
father’s lands in 1071,21 was Great Chamberlain under William I, as ,
