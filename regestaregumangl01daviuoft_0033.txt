ς1921 103. It is therefore possible that he was the progenitor of Gilbert
who held the Chief Marshalship under Henry I, and who was succeeded
before 1130 by his son John the Μ6151161.1

RoGER appears in 1086 as holding land in Essex2 which had originally
been worth 233. He does not aot as a witness to royal charters.

MILO appears as the owner of land which afterwards passed to St. Stephen
of ann.3 I have been unable to identify him with any of the persons of
his name who are mentioned in Orderic or in ΜΓ. Round's calendar. He
had a daughter who married a certain Arphast.

ᾧ 21. Pincernae or Butler&

HUGH oF Ivm and ROGER OF Ivm both appear with the title of pincerna.
In 1086 Roger was a tenant in chief in 51Χ English shires, while Hugh held
estates of little consequence in Oxfordshire and Bedfordshire. This is to
be explained by the fact that Hugh was Butler in the Norman household ;
he has the title before 1066.4 Hugh makes his last appearance in our
calendar in a charter of 1082, which he attests in his brother's company.5
Roger is styled pincerna as early as 1069, and he witnesses a charter of
Duke Robert in 1089.6 We find him about 1078 acting as custodian of the
Tower at 11011611.τ

[ALURED‚ who attests as pincerna between 1082 and 1084,⁸ is designated
butler of the Count of Mortain in the index to Mr. Round's calendar.
Certainly he appears as a witness to two of the Count’s 0116113615;9 and
both in Dorset and in Sussex we find an Alured holding lands from the

ἦ Count. The Dorset entry is particularly significant, as Alured pincerna

 

 

 

appears to have been a benefactor of Shaftesbury Abbey.¹⁰]

ROBERT FITZ Tusssmm attests charters both of William I and of William Π.
We find him in the Oxfordshire Domesday as a king’s serjeant‚ holding
lands in Great Rollright and Ledwell.11 He was succeeded, before the
death of William ΙΙ, by his son Turstin.12 By 1105 Turstin had been
succeeded by his son Hugo. It does not seem to have been noticed that
6 Robert fitz Turstin appears among those who followed Bohemond on the
First Crusade.13 But it would be perilous to insist upon the coincidence
of names.

Rocffln MALA CORONA, dispenset in the Norman household, may have
belonged to the Norman family which traced its descent from Giroie.
Ralph Mala Corona, a son of Giroie, figures repeatedly in the pages of
Orderic Vitalis. Ralph became a monk about 1052,14 after an adventurous
career. Whatever his ancestry‚ Roger plays no part in history. We
know of him only as attesting a charter of Duke Robert between 1087
and 109l.¹5
