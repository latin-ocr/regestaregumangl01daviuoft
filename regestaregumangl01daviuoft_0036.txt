xxx INTRODUCTION

should be compared with an earlier grant (of Edward the Confessor) giving
to the Abbot of Ramsey the hundreda] jurisdiction over men that are
moot-worthy and fyrd-worthy.¹ Though the authenticity of the latter
document is not above suspicion, it is at least admissible evidence of a
tradition that only a limited class of men were competent to attend the
public courts in the Anglo-Saxon period. Our charters show that exemptions
from suit of shire were sometimes granted without any express exception.
But these exemptions are generally given to the tenants of highly privileged
monasteries2 (Westminster, Battle, St. Paul's, and St. Swithin of Winchester).
The only case in which we seem to find a layman claiming that his estates
were privileged against the jurisdiction of the shire seems to be that of the
rebel Earl Roger of Hereford‚ in 1075 3³ and here we are not fully informed
as to the nature of the privilege which was claimed.

ᾧ 26. Τ110 hundred-court appears, like the shire-court, chiefly as a tribunal
for investigating cases of title.4 A ι]“011113 sessions of three hundreds and a
half is ordered in one case by William II.5 Presumably the hundred-court
was by this time concerned with view of frankpledge3 but there seems to be
no reference to this institution in the charters of William I and William Π. ’
It never appears among the long list of the franchises granted to the great
religious houses in this period. General exemptions from suit of hundred
are not infrequent, though in some cases we find grants of particular hundred-
courts to religious houses. The most privileged foundation in this respect
was Bury St. Edmunds with a jurisdiction over eight and a half hundreds ⁰
dating from pre-Conquest times. Evesham Abbey is confirmed in the
possession of the hundred of Fisbeorga3 Ely in that of five Suffolk hundreds.
The Bishop of Worcester retains Oswaldslaw3 Abingdon, the hundred of
Hormer; St. Mary of Stow, the wapentake of We11.⁷ William II grants
the hundred of Normancros in see-farm to the monks of Thorney 3 and grants
to Robert Bloet, Bishop of Lincoln, the ferm of the third penny of Estou
wapentake.⁸ Two new grants in a period of thirty-four years do not suggest
that the process of leasing hundreds was advancing rapidly.

ᾧ 27. On the administration of the shires the charters give us little
information. They enable us to supplement the lists of sheriffs which can be
constructed from Domesday and other sources, and they show that sheriff-
doms changed hands with some frequency. They show that the bishop of
the shire was regularly associated with the sheriff in the presidency of the
shire-court. Sometimes they are addressed to the earl⁹ as well as to the
sheriff and bishop3 and again, where no earl is mentioned, we find a local
magnate addressed in addition to the sheriff.¹⁰ A more complicated case is
afforded by a writ concerning Staffordshire lands in which commands are
given to Leofwin‚ Bishop of Lichfield, to Earl Edwin, to Thurkill the sheriff,
and to Abbot AEgelwy of Eveshamss The latter seems to be acting as a local
