how in the time of William I knight’s fees were created 011 1116 lands of Arch-
bishop Lanfranc. ‘ Quia vero non erant adhuc tempore Regis Willielmi
milites in Anglia, sed Threnges, precepit Rex ut de 613 milites fierent ad
terram defendendam. Fecit autem Lanfrancus Threngos suos milites3
monachi vero non fecerunt, sed dc portione sua ducentas libratas terre dederunt
Archiepiscopo, ut per milites suos terras eorum defenderet, et ut omnia negotia
eorum apud Curiam Romanam suis expensis expediret. Unde adhuc in tota
terra monachorum nullus miles est, sed in terra Archiepiscopi. Terram autem
ducentarum librarum adhuc habent Archiepiscopi.'
