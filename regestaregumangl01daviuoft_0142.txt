The style is that of William I; but he had no chancellor named Roger3 if the 611611161- 15
genuine, the style has been altered by a copyist and the chancellor must be Robert

Bloet. But probably the chartei· is forged.

L 358. Charter by Roger Earl of Sfflewsbury, to the house of Ste. Marie of

aSglngdting to it the church of St. Milburga [Wenlock Priory, 60. Salop],

the consent of William II.

[Gough MSS„ vol. iii, p. 59 (late transcript).
Eyton, Antiquities of Shropshz're, iii. 228]
Τ116 language inflated, but the substance may well 116 genuine. Three dating and
testing clauses (mutually inconsistent) are added ; but Eyton shows that these formed

no part of the original document. Wenlock was founded by Earl Roger as an ,

abbey (D. B. i. 252 b).
