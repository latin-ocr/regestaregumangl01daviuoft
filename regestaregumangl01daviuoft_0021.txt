INTRODUCTION xv

and re-endowing the capitular clergy.l His episcopal career is precisely
what would be expected of a capable official, who places his knowledge of
men and business at the service of the church. He is the only king's priest
who obtained high promotion between 1053 and 1061. We incline to see
in him the official successor of Leofric and Ulf and Kinsige.

ᾧ 7. To terminate a long discussion: we are disposed to think that the
organization, though not the name, of the chancery can be traced back at
least to the early years of Edward the Confessor3 that the head of the
chancery held office for a few years at most3 and that his position entitled
him to hope for a good bishopric as his ultimate reward. We think that
this position, the chancellorship as it is called after 1061, was held succes·
sively by Stigand, Leofric, Ulf‚ Kinsige, and Griso. There may have been
others who held the office for short periods (e.g. Hermann of Ramsbury,
William of London); but there are reasons for thinking that the five
chaplains whom we name were of exceptional consequence in the administra-
tive sphere.

§8 We now come to Regenbald, and here we are on firmer ground.
The evidence concerning Regenbald is not copious3 but it enables us to
draw some positive conclusions. Regenbald was a king’s priest and engaged
in the work of the chancery as early as the year 10503 he remained in the
chancery till the close of Edward’s reign, and he subsequently took service
under the Conqueror. No ecclesiastical preferment was given to him by
the Confessor‚ and we cannot safely speak of him as chancellor before the
year 1062, when he attests a genuine charter with that style.2 Whether he
was an Englishman or a foreigner we cannot say3 though he has been
labelled by some modern writers as a foreigner (presumably on the strength
of his name) he was not obnoxious to the house of Godwin3 and his
function under William I was to acquaint the new ruling class with the
Old English forms of administration. If he had been a man of outstanding
personality, he would have made a greater mark in his long career. As
it is we only know of his existence through a few charters attested by
him 3 or issued in his favour, a few entries in Domesday Book, and the
foundation charter of Cirencester Abbey,4 to which Henry Ι confirmed
his rich possessions, Regenbald ended his days at Cirencester, at the
head of a college of prebendaries-——a dignified position, but greatly inferior
to those which several of his old associates had obtained. The chaplain
Baldwin‚ who attests with him in 1062, had been promoted to the abbacy
of Bury by the Confessor.5 Osbern and Peter, who, like Regenbald, passed
into the service of William Ι, obtained in due course the sees of Exeter
and Lichfield. Osbern, it is true, was a brother of William fitz Osbern‚⁶
and therefore had special claims to promotion. But Peter had no such
claims.
