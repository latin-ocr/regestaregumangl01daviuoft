documents. Tho chartei-s of Stephen form a smaller and less
valuable serios: but the third volume will also contain the charters
issuod by the Empress Matilda and by Henry of Anjou in the years
1135-54.

No collection of this kind can boast of being definitive. But this
calendar embodies the results of considerable researches among the
manuscript sources to be found in the Record Office, the British
Museuni, the Bodleian Library, the muniments of Lincoln, Ely,
Canterbury, York, Durham, and Westminster Abbey. From the
responsible officials of these collections the editor has received much
valuable information and counse13 it is not their fault if he or his
hclpers have failed to notice relevant documents. Whatever
lacunae may be detected in the calendar, he hopes that it will at
least serve as a basis for future research. And it may be claimed
that, even where the calendar deals with material already known
and printed, it will be found useful as calling attention to errors of
the printed texts, as correeting accepted dates, and as discussing the
authenticity of questionable charters.

The calendar was planned in 1904 by a group of Oxford mediae-
valists, who at that time felt the need of such a guide to assist
them in their private researches. The original idea was to make
a hand-list of the printed documents3 the persons interested were
each asked to undertake the examination of some definite part of
the relevant literature. The present editor undertook to direct the
work and to co-ordinate the material, But the pressure of other
duties prevented all but one of his collaborators from giving regular
assistance, after the preliminary stages of the work were finished.
Others, however, came to his aid 3 and owing to their friendly
encouragement the scheme developed. He is under obligations
to many scholars for copies of documents, for notices of printed
material, and for critical observations. He would in particular offer
his thanks to Mr. F. Morgan of Keble College 3 Professor Stenton of
Reading ; Mr. Craster of the Bodleian Library 3 the Rev. H. E. Salter
of tho Oxford Historical Society (who lent most liberally from his
invaluablo store of transcripts); Messrs Grump, Fowler, and Johnson
of the Public Record Office3 Mr. K. Bayley, the keeper of the
Durham muniments3 Dr. Armitage Robinson, Dean of Wells3
