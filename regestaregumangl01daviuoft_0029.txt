INTRODUOTION xxiii

'appears at William's court as a witness to charters of 1068 and 1069.1
Before 1075 113 had been succeeded as sheriff by his son Swegen ; 2 who lost
that office before 1086,3 but transmitted the honour of Rayleigh to his son
Robert of Essex.

ᾧ 17. Dapz'fers ον Seneschals. These titles are convertible, but the former
is commonly used in England, the latter in Normandy.

HUBERT, who occurs as a benefactor to St. Stephen of Caen, should
probably be identified with Hubert de 1113, 1113 father of Eudo Dapifer.

⁴ The charter which gives Hubert his official style is not later than 1077

and seems to imply that Hubert was by that time deceased.4 Hubert
witnesses two documents which Dr. Round has calendared3 one of these
belongs to.the year 1060, while the other is not later than 1070.5 He had
been a man of consequence in Normandy as early as 1047 .ss Τ113 Hubert de
1113 who witnesses charters of 1091 and 1092 ⁷ is perhaps a younger name-
sake. Louis, son of Hubert the Seneschal, attests a charter of Henry Ι,
which is dated 1110.8

EUDo Frrz HUBERT first appears with the style of Dapz‘fer in or about
1072,9 and frequently attests 1113 charters both of William I and of
William ΙΙ. Possibly he inherited his dignity from his father.

EUDo HALDUP, vicomte of 1113 0013111111, does 1101 bear the title of
Dapzfer or seneschal in royal charters. But he held the office 3 so much is
proved by a passage in Orderic vitalis, and an incidental reference in

W1LL1AM FiTz OSBERT‚ one of the most important figures, in the charters
and in English history, between 1066 and 1071, certainly succeeded his
father Osbert as seneschal in Normandy. The fact was questioned by
Mr. Vernon Harcourt, whose doubt was treated as legitimate by Dr. Round3¹¹
but Professor Haskins has since produced evidence which sets the doubt
at rest.¹2

GERALD, who attests 33 Seneschal in 1066,¹3 is probably to be identified
with Gerold Dapz'fer, whom Orderic names as the Castellan of Neufmarche
about 1064, and who still held that office in 1067.¹4

Gronmo Dapifer does not occur in the charters of William Ι; but is found
in 1086 as a tenant in chief of lands in East Anglia.¹5 He is addressed in
a charter of William ΙΙ, from which it would appear that about 1087 he was
a sheriff in Norfolk or Suffolk.16

HAIMo occurs with the style of Dapzfer in a charter of 1069.1⁷ He was
the son of Haimo ‘Dentatus' who was slain at Val 33 Dunes in 1047. He
held the sheriffdom of Kent and both in charters ¹3 and in Domesday Book
is frequently styled Haimo vicecomes. He died before the year 1100‚¹⁹
leaving two sons, Haimo and Robert. The former succeeded his father as
