151. Mandate by William I to Abp. Lanfranc [MS. Tit. adds ‘and Gosfrid'].

That the consecration of [Simeon] the Abbot of Ely, which Remigius the
Bishop [of Lincoln] claims, is to be postponed till the King has seen the evidence
in the Bishop's favour. The mill built by Picot at Cambridge shall be destroyed
if it injures the other. Let what pertains to Christian religion be done in the
abbey. Bp. Remigius may have his customary dues of wine if he can prove
that his ancestors had them in the time of King Edward.

152, Precept by William I to Abp. Lanfranc.

To inspect the charters of [Simeon] the Abbot of Ely; and if they say that
the Abbot ought to be consecrated wherever the King pleases, then consecrate
him. To make those repair the causeway at Ely who are wont to do so.
Το inquire, through the Bishop of Coutances and Bishop Walkelin and the rest,
who caused the lands of St. Etheldritha to be enrolled and swern, how they
were sworn‚ by whom, before what witnesses, and what are the lands and
their names and size and who hold them. Let the King know the truth by
letter by the hand of the Abbot's messenger.

That [Simeon] the Abbot of Ely have his benediction forthwith and his
lands and customs, as the King has frequently commanded by his letters.
Whatever part of his demesne the Abbot acquires by legal process, he is to
alienate it to no one without the royal licence. ⁶ Et sede placitorum 01 facite
rectum defendentes ut nullus eius incidat siluas.' The Abbot is to have his
fortified house in Ν orwich‚ and his men may be there when they have need.

154, Precept by William Ι to Abp. Lanfranc and Geoffrcy Bp. of Coutances
and Robert Count of Mortain.

Do not let Bishop Remigius claim new customs in the isle of Ely. If
Remigius wishes to go to law about this, let him plead as he would have done
in the days of King Edward, and let the plea take place in your presence.
Let Abbot Simeon be quit of the ward of Norwich3 ⁶ sed ibi munitionem
suam conduci faciat et custodiri.' Stay the proceedings in the claims of
William of Ou, and Ralph fitz Waleran and Robert Gernon, unless they are
