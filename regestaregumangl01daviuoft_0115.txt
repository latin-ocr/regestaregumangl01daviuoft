111 D. Β. we find Evesham holding Lench-Wick, Atch-Lench and Church-Lench (V. C. H.
Worc. i. 290, 307). But this perhaps refers to Lench Sheriffs (D.B. i. 176) which

XVHUHaJ I confirmed to Evesham‚ but Odo of Bayeux afterwards seized and gave

This may be by William 113 but that king in his confirmation of 1099 does not refer to

any previous charter of his own on this subject. 01. infra, No. 274.

This is really nothing more than a historia fundationis, to which the scribe has added the
words: ‘ haec omnia ego Willelmus rex Anglorum concessi et sigillo meo 0011-
firmavi.' It purports to be drawn up after the death of Countess Mabel.

250, Notification by William I to Ilbert 01 Hertford and all his lieges. [1066-87]
That he confirms to St. Peter 01 Westminster the land 01 Wormley which

Leofsin 01 London gave to the said church‚ to hold as freely as King Edward

and the present King previously confirmed this gift.

[Westminster Abbey ‘ Domesday '‚ 10. 678 v⁰ (copy).]

For Edward the Confessor’s confirmation see Menas-ticon, i. 299, No. 18.

This land is not entered in Doniesday as belonging to Westminster. In Wormley the
tenants T. RE. had been the canons of Waltham, Alsi a man of Eddeva, and

Wluuard a man of Esegar the staller (D. B. i. 1361), 137, 142). Βο1 1110 successor of
Wluuard was Alwin Dodesone. Leofsin was also surnained Dodesone (Monasticon,
i. 299, No. 18), and his is presumably the holding in question.
