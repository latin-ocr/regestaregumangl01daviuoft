WILLIAM THE OONQUEROR

[Westminster Abbcy ⁴ Domesday '‚ fo. 47 (copy).]

Tho reference is to 6 dispute with Anselm‚ when Abbot of Bec, respecting the manor of
Tooting Bec. That the holding of Westminster in Tooting concerned the sheriffs
both of Essex and Surrey appears from another chartei· (spurious) which is printed
by Armitage Robinson, Gilhert Crispin, p. 128 (supra, No. 181).

215. * Notification (spurious) by William I, ‘Dei gratia rex Anglie,' to his
bisliops, barons, &c., and the burgesses of London.

That 116 1165 confirmed to St. Peter of Westminster, for his own salvation
and that of King Edward his kinsman, all the lands in London which the
saint used to hold by the gift of King Edward or others. These and 611 future
gifts within the said borough (buryo) are to be held with all the rights and
customs granted by King Edward.

Witnesses: Walchelin Bp. of Winchester3 William Bp. of Durham3 R[obert]
Count of Meulan 3 H[ugh] Earl of Chester.

[Westminster Abbey ‘Domesday '‚ fo. 100 v0 (copy).]

This has 6 family resemblance to the other Westminster charters concerning the rights
of the monks in London.

216, * Notification (spurious) by William I, ‘ Dei gratia rex Anglorum,' to
G[eoffrey] de Mandeville, and the sheriff and William the Chamberlain and 611
1115 citizens and officials of London.

That 116 1165 granted to God and St. Peter and Abbot Vitalis and the monks
of Westminster, for his own salvation and for love of his kinsman, King
Edward, 611 the lands in London which King Edward gave to the place of his
buriaL and 67111611 William himself has subsequently added or any one 6156
1165 given3 to hold with 566 and 506, miskenning and sceawinge. They are to
hold freely their market-places (nundi‘nalia et (wy'iste‘ria, id est mercatoria
loca) with their stalls and shops (sealdis et ι5601111015) and rents, and their meat-
market (macella), and the rights and tolls appropriated to the lights of the
chureh, as King Edward commanded. All merchants who in Edward's time
landed or put in at the 506 or stalls or wharves of St. Peter to lodge there,
may now return thither under the King's peace. No sheriff or other official
is to molest them on pain of ι1310 forfeiture.

The inferior limit of date is given by the mention of Abbot Vitalis.
This chartei· is either a forgery or grossly interpolated.

217. * Notification (spurious) by William to his sheriffs and officials and all η 1
his lieges of London. ἒ

That he has confirmed to God and St. Peter of Westminster and Abbot 1
Vitalis the gift which Alwold of St. Botulf's Gate gave to them when he ε
became 6 monk there 3 that is his house (curia) and 6 6711611 at the head of j
London Bridge, and his other lands in the said city, as King Edward con-

firmed them 3 to be held with 566 and soc and all customs.
